# sql-challenge In this assignment, I performed an analysis using SQL and python/pandas on the employee records of a company called Pewlett Hackard.  I compiled several tables using SQL and performed several queries to examine the data. Some of the data looked suspicious. For example, there were a number of repeat names. 255 in this company have had the name Hercules -- including quite a few women. To perform a further analysis, I looked at the data in python and ran several charts to look for more anomalies. I found that almost 1 in 3 people at the company had the same salary $40,000. I also found that people with higher rank and titles were paid, on average, less than those with lower ranks. Even the maxium salaries for higher ranked staff members were lower than the maximum salaries of people with lower ranks. Lastly, I looked up a specific Employee Number and found a very fishy name, April Foolsday! The data was fake!  I used sqlalchemy to pull this data into Python and then I used my knowledge of Pandas and Matplotlib to run visualizations. This allowed me to exercise my Python coding skills so that I stay sharp. Also, i learned some new code in python, "str.contains" to show the suspicious frequency of a certain name. I look forward to using my sqlalchemy skills for further analyses.
